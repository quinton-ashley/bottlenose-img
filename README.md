I have no 3ds, ps2, ps3, switch, or wiiu game boxes, manuals, memory cards, etc. and will not be able to make the open box menu support these system on my own without these assets.  Please help me if you can!

# Taking Photos

To contribute to this repo take a look at the assets I did as examples.  If you only have a smart phone you can still contribute to this project but you must use the Adobe Lightroom app and shoot in Pro mode with raw DNG selected.  Photos from the default iPhone camera are compressed in size and resolution, they don't capture what your phone's sensor is capable of.  If you have a nice DSLR or large format analog camera that'd be even better of course.  I used a desktop light with a white bulb and daylight, don't use a yellow/orange light source.  Shot from the center, laying the asset out as flat as possible.

# Editing

Manuals and memory cards are easy, just take a shot of them from the center and then mask them out from the background.  To get the edges of the game box to be artificially straight I used photoshop's perspective warp tool.  By selected each section of the open box (front, side, back) you can then warp those points to sit perfectly straight with the edges of the image.

Images should be exported at high resolution in png-8 format.
