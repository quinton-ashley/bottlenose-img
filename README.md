I have no 3ds, ps2, ps3, switch, or wiiu game boxes, manuals, memory cards, etc. and will not be able to make the open box menu support these system on my own without these assets.  Please help me if you can!  You can just send photos or help edit them too.  Before contributing to this repo please take a look at the assets I did as examples.

# Taking Photos

If you only have a smart phone you can still contribute to this project but you must use the Adobe Lightroom app and shoot in Pro mode using the raw .DNG filetype.  Photos taken with the default iPhone camera app are compressed in size, reducing image quality and resolution, they don't capture what the sensor is capable of.  I used an iPhone 6s Plus.  If you have a nice DSLR or large format analog camera that'd be even better of course.  I used a desktop light with a white bulb and daylight, don't use a yellow/orange light source.  Shoot from the center of the item, laying it out as flat as possible.  Try to avoid reflections.

## Highly Reflective Items

If the item is highly reflective, you can try taking two pictures on a tripod and moving your light source so reflections occur on opposite sides.  The reflections can then be edited out by combining the photos.

# Editing

## Manuals and Memory Cards

Simply add a transparency layer and erase the background.

## Open Game Boxes

To get the edges of the game box to be artificially straight I used photoshop's perspective warp tool.  Place rectangles over each section of the box, you can then warp those points to sit perfectly straight with the edges of the image.

## Highly Reflective Items

Align the two images you took so that they match perfectly.  Cross-fade between the sides with no reflections.

# Submissions

Please send me <mailto:qashto@gmail.com> your original photos in lossless quality (.dng) and if you made edits, send me the photoshop/gimp files via google docs, dropbox, etc.
